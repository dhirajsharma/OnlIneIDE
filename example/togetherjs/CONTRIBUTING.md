Thanks for your interest in contributing to TogetherJS!

If you found a bug, if at all possible give us a URL where we can try
TogetherJS.  Don't worry about tags or milestones or assigning the
ticket.  But a URL is extremely helpful!

## Contributing

The [Contributing](https://togetherjs.com/docs/contributing.html)
document on the site gives some more information.  Some relevant
points:

* [Javascript style guide](https://github.com/ianb/javascript)

* If you want to work on a ticket, please leave a comment to that
  effect.  It gives us a chance to suggest where you'd look in the
  code to implement the feature or fix the bug, and makes it less
  likely that people's contributions will conflict.

* Anything in the
  [Blue Sky](https://github.com/mozilla/togetherjs/issues?milestone=23&page=1&state=open)
  you are likely to find something that we're interested in having in
  TogetherJS, but that we aren't working on.

* If you have an idea of your own you'd like to implement, please open
  a ticket describing it.  That will let other people know you are
  working on it, and give other people an opportunity to give feedback
  or implementation notes.

## Where to start?

You should look at the
[Contribution Wanted](https://github.com/mozilla/togetherjs/issues?labels=contribution-wanted&milestone=&page=1&state=open)
tag to see tickets that fall into two categories:

1. A good introductory task to get started on.

2. Something that requires particular skills (that the core team does
   not have) that would make a contribution particular valuable.
